## Newton's method
Returning to logistic regression, Letâ€™s now talk about a different algorithm for maximizing $$\ell(\theta)$$.
To get us started, let's consider Newton's method for finding a zero of a function. Specifically, suppose we have some function $$f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$$, and we want to find a value of $\theta$ so that $$f(\theta)=0$$. Here, $$\theta \in \mathbb{R}$$ is a real number.
