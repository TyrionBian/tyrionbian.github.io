# Thomas' Calculus, 13th Edition with SI Units by George B. Thomas

## Chapter 10  
### Taylor and Maclaurin Series
**DEFINITIONS**
Let $f$ be a function with derivatives of all orders throughout some interval containing a as an interior point. Then the **Taylor series generated by $f$ at $x = a$** is:  
\$$
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k = f(a) &+ f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f\'\'(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2  \newline
&+ \cdots + \frac {f^{(n)}(x-a)}{n!}(x-a)^n + \cdots ;
 \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

The **Maclaurin series of $f$** is the Taylor series generated by $f$ at $x = 0$.
